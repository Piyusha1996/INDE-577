# INDE-577 - Data science &amp; machine learning projects
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebook projects that I worked on as part of a graduate-level industrial engineering course on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning. The course covered a range of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

This repository contains my data science and machine learning projects. I am currently studying the following topics in my course:

- Supervised Learning:
  - Model Building and Error Analysis
  - Linear Regression
  - Gradient Descent
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Nets
  - Support Vector Machines
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision/ Regression Trees
  - Ensemble Learning
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - k-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis
- Reinforcement Learning:
  - Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods


I will be implementing these algorithms from scratch and also making use of popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. My projects will include both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, with a focus on real-world applications.
