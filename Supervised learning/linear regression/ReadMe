#Linear Regression 

It is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. This technique is applicable for Supervised Learning Regression problems where we try to predict a continuous variable. Linear Regression can be further classified into two types â€“ Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In this project, I employ Simple Linear Regression technique where I have one independent and one dependent variable. It is the simplest form of Linear Regression where we fit a straight line to the data.
