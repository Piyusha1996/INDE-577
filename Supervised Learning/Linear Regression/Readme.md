Linear regression is a statistical method frequently used in machine learning and data science to analyze the linear relationship between two variables, namely an independent variable and a dependent variable. The algorithm helps to forecast future outcomes by predicting how fluctuations in the independent variable will affect the dependent variable.

The independent variable, also known as the predictor or explanatory variable, remains constant as other variables change. Conversely, the dependent variable changes as the independent variable fluctuates. The regression model predicts the value of the dependent variable, which is the outcome variable being studied or analyzed.

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts continuous or numeric variables, such as age, salary, product price, and sales, by simulating a mathematical relationship between variables. It is a useful method for stock market forecasting, scientific analysis, and portfolio management when there are at least two variables available in the data.

The linear regression model is represented by a straight line with a slope, which can be used to make predictions for new data points. The line of regression is the best-fit line that represents the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

In summary, linear regression is a valuable algorithm for predicting the outcome of future events by analyzing the linear relationship between two variables.
