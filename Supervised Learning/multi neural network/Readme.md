# Multi-Layer Neural Network

A multi-layer neural network is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, where each layer processes the output of the previous layer. The first layer, called the input layer, receives input data and passes it on to the next layer. The last layer, called the output layer, produces the final output of the network. In between the input and output layers, there can be one or more hidden layers that allow the network to learn more complex patterns in the input data.

The process of training a multi-layer neural network involves adjusting the weights of the synaptic connections between neurons in order to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual output. This is typically done using a technique called backpropagation, which involves propagating the error backwards through the network and adjusting the weights accordingly.

Multi-layer neural networks are used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. In recent years, the development of deep learning techniques, which involve training neural networks with many layers, has led to significant advances in these areas.

To implement a multi-layer neural network in Python, you can use a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. These frameworks provide high-level abstractions for defining and training neural networks, as well as support for GPU acceleration to speed up the training process. Alternatively, you can implement a neural network from scratch using NumPy or another numerical computing library, although this will require more low-level coding and may be less efficient than using a framework.

Activation function: Each neuron in a multi-layer neural network applies an activation function to its input before passing it on to the next layer. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh.

Training: The training process for a multi-layer neural network typically involves forward propagation and backpropagation. During forward propagation, the input data is passed through the layers of the network to produce an output. The output is then compared to the expected output, and the error is calculated. During backpropagation, the error is propagated backwards through the network, and the weights of the synaptic connections are adjusted to reduce the error.
